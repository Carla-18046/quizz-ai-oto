When players respond to questions, they receive immediate insights into why their answers were correct or incorrect, along with additional context or trivia related to the topic. <br /><br />This feature not only enriches the gaming experience but also transforms it into an educational opportunity, allowing players to learn as they play. The integration of AI thus elevates Quizz-AI-Oto beyond mere entertainment, positioning it as a valuable resource for knowledge acquisition.<br /><br /></p>
